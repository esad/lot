- Clarify keyboard zigzag and multiple updates, then
    Disable left/right while editing

Elm:
- ask for onCreate to avoid focus port
- dom event on element create/destroy -> perhaps a plugin

<!-- - Edit -> StartEdit char
- FinishEdit/CancelEdit

- click on selected -> edit with value
- maybe doubleclick can be removed
- enter to edit -> value
- arrows when editing only up down
